/*

JSX stands for JavaScript XML... 
In this lecture I have used codesandbox.io to implement the react...
Following is the code--->

	import React from "react";
	import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

	ReactDOM.render(
	  <div>
	    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
	    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
	  </div>,
	  document.getElementById("root")
	);


I have used two dependencies here named 
1----> react
2----> react-dom
